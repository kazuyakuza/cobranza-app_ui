# Changelog

All notable changes to `@cobranza-apps/ui` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> Releases prior to 0.8.1 predate this changelog and are not reconstructed retroactively.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added a complete Design Tokens reference to `docs/USAGE.md`, with value tables for
  backgrounds, text, borders, accents, interactive states, and shadows.
- Added grouped section comments inside `src/theme/_variables.scss` documenting each token group.

### Changed

- **Lightened the intermediate-gray theme palette** (see [brief.md §5](.agent/project-info/brief.md#5-design-tokens-theme)).
  Background surfaces shifted to a lighter medium-gray scale (`#2a2d32` → `#7a838d`).
- Updated text tokens to near-black (`#e8eaed` → `#0f1115`) for stronger legibility on lighter
  backgrounds.
- Adjusted interactive `hover`/`active` states from white overlays to subtle dark overlays.
- Reduced shadow opacity for module and elevated surfaces.
- Reduced the modal/overlay backdrop from `0.55` to `0.32` opacity.
- Reorganized `src/theme/_variables.scss` with section comments and deduplicated the
  `--cba-border-subtle` token (now aliases `--cba-bg-elevated`). **No token names changed**,
  so this is a drop-in update.
- Updated theme documentation (`docs/THEME.md`, `docs/USAGE.md`, `README.md`, and the project
  brief) to reflect the lightened token values and renamed `#5-design-tokens-theme` anchors.

### Fixed

- Fixed text-contrast compliance: darkened `--cba-text-secondary` to `#15181c` and
  `--cba-text-muted` to `#212429` so intended text/background pairs meet WCAG AA 4.5:1.
  - `--cba-text-secondary` on `--cba-bg-primary`: 4.63:1.
  - `--cba-text-muted` on `--cba-bg-secondary`: 5.13:1.
  - Intentional exception: `--cba-text-muted` on `--cba-bg-primary` is 4.05:1; library
    components must not use this pair. Use `--cba-text-secondary` on `--cba-bg-primary` for
    lower-emphasis text.
